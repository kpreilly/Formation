    "\n",
    "1. Understanding the Base Algorithm\n",
    "    - Sort problems by topic\n",
    "    - Sort by difficult, easy -> hard\n",
    "    - Grind out the easy questions and try to understand them as much as you can.\n",
    "    - Look at the discussion/solution to get clarity if stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identifying Algorithm in Questions\n",
    "    - For every question you do in the above section, go to the left tab and look at the \"Similar Questions\" section.\n",
    "    - Do every question within 1-level-higher of the similar questions.\n",
    "    - Really look at the question, and try and find hints to affirm that the algorithm you used previously applies to this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modifying Algorithm for Specific Questions\n",
    "    - As you do the above questions, solve the question utilizing your previous solution and change the pieces that need to be changed.\n",
    "    - Recommend NOT looking at the solution/discussion until you feel like you're at the point of (mental/emotional) failure\n",
    "\n",
    "Study Guide:\n",
    "- Copy/Paste the Question and Implementation\n",
    "- Write a paragraph summary in human-readable format explaining the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep track of the questions that you didn't do well on\n",
    "    - Come back to that question a week later\n",
    "\n",
    "A week before any of your big interviews, allocate time to do questions filtered by company/frequency\n",
    "    - These will have questions you'll most likely get\n",
    "    - You should be more comfortable around questions like this, that you haven't seen before\n",
    "    - And you'll get more exposure around those questions\n",
    "    - NOTE: I got a shit ton of those most-frequent questions in my interviews\n",
